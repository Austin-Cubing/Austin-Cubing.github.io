# About
A [cube](https://cubecobra.com/content/article/5f6051acdfc243103ad4b6db) is a large collection of (often powerful) cards used for drafting and playing limited Magic: The Gathering (MTG). Drafting a cube is similar to drafting booster packs, but instead of drafting from three fifteen-card Magic booster packs, you draft from fifteen-card "packs" that you create from your cube.

The Austin Cubing Discord was started in 2023 by [grenrut](https://cubecobra.com/user/view/5e5d9d8c4e778f6d0803a811), an avid cube designer who has been featured at CubeCon and maintains many popular cubes, including [The Tempo Cube](https://cubecobra.com/cube/overview/tempocube).

We organize cube drafts weekly at local games stores in the Austin TX area, as well as host discussions on cube design, custom cards, and more.
